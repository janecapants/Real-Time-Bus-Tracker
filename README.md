# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## This project shows the route of a bus on Central Park West in New York City using location markers.

## Description
### Click the box in the upper left hand corner that says "Show bus stops along Central Park West" and the tracker will move to the stops the bus makes. I changed the color of the button and the text contained inside the button. I added a shadow to the box and outlined the text as well. I wanted the colors to match some of those on the map. 

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up the CSS, javascript, and html file last. 

## Furture Improvements
### I'd like to make it more specific so users would know the exact location by hovering over the location marker.
